## Notes:

- Add your desired background image files
**`/css/main.css`: LINE 38 & 55**:

```
background: url("background_day.jpg");
```

_NOTE_: Background DAY displays from 0800-2000 local browser time


- Turn ON search auto-complete by changing the value to `< "autocomplete="ON" >` at the following location:

**`/index.html`: LINE 259:**

```
<input type="search" id="flexbox-input" name="s" value="" placeholder=" Search..." autocomplete="off" spellcheck="false" autofocus>
```

### WEATHER DATA: 
- Acquire your FREE API key and replace the default key in **`/js/weather.js` : LINE 12**
 https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up
 
```
   var weatherApiKey = ' YOUR KEY HERE ';
```

- Change the default temp unit from F to C by changing the following two items:

**`/index.html`: LINE 122:**

```
<div id="unit" class="unit hidden">&degF</div>
```

**`/js/weather.js`: LINE 8:**

```
var unit = 'metric';
```

- Weather auto refresh default setting is  **30** seconds (2 calls per minute), or 30000(ms). Max is 60 API calls per 1 minute. Change at the following location:

**`/js/weather.js` : LINE 201:**

```
var t = window.setInterval(searchByLocation, 30000);
```

### TICKER DATA: 
- You will need to create your own feed.mikle ticker widget where you can customize your RSS news sources and style.  To do so, go to https://feed.mikle.com, create an account, and replicate the settings of the screenshot image `/img/feedmikle.jpg ` located in this repo. You will then have your own custom ticker widget URL which you will then input into  **`/index.html` : Line 287**:
 
 ```
 <script src="https://feed.mikle.com/js/fw-loader.js" data-fw-param=" YOUR NUMBER HERE "></script>
 ```

## LIVE Search Usage:

### Key Searching:

- Make changes to the live search behavior in `/js/tilde.js` .

- To view the available sites and their keys, press `?` for the help menu.
(NOTE: the Help menu only appears on desktop browsers). 

You can search any of the sites by typing a colon after the site's key, followed by your search query. 
For example:

- Entering `g:tilde` would search
  [GitHub for tilde](https://github.com/search?q=tilde).
- Entering `s:radiohead` would search
  [SoundCloud for radiohead](https://soundcloud.com/search?q=radiohead).

If your input doesn't match any of the commands, a generic Google search will be triggered.

### Specific Locations:

You can go to a specific location on a site by typing a forward slash after the
site's key, followed by the location on the site you'd like to be redirected to.
For example:

- Entering `r/r/startpages` would redirect you to
  [www.reddit.com/r/startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages)
- Entering `h/popular` would redirect you to
  [hypem.com/popular](http://hypem.com/popular).

### URL Redirects:

If you enter in a full domain or URL, you will be redirected to said domain or
URL. For example:

- Entering `stallman.org` would redirect you to
  [stallman.org](https://stallman.org/).
- Entering `https://smile.amazon.com` would redirect you to
  [smile.amazon.com](https://smile.amazon.com/).
