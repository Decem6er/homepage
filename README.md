You will need to create your own FREE feed.mikle ticker widget.  To do so, go to https://feed.mikle.com and replicate the settings of the screenshot image "/img/feedmikle.jpg" located in this repo. You will then have your own custom ticker widget URL which you will then input into index.html as outlined above.
